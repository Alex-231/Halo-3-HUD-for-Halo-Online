IMPORTANT: Please backup your Halo folder, as this Pre-Release has been know to cause a few tag corruptions. 
Usually they're fixed pretty quickly but a backup always comes in handy.

# Halo-3-HUD-for-Halo-Online
A remake of the Halo 3 HUD (and a few other things) for Halo Online. Installer coming soon.

To Install:
1. Extract the zip to your maps folder.
2. Run the installer.

BACKUP YOUR TAGS!
- This is important as the installer has been known to corrupt the tags file during testing.
