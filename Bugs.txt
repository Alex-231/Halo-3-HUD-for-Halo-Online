Bugs:

Monitor (000025F4)
	- The health bar has a line on the right side. 
	- The radar is oval, like the spartan's radar, when it should be circle.
	- The radar blips are smaller.
	- Distortion is broken.

Sandbox (000012C1)
	- The crosshair shouldn't be centered. This is making scaling the binoculars a difficulty.

Spartan (00000C1E)

Weapon CHDT's
	- The infinate ammo symbol is broken.
	- The pickup weapon widget is incorrect. this should be handled by the weapon tag, like the out of ammo text.
		- This is also breaking the dual weild pickup text, and presumably the take from ally text.

	RNG Covanant Carbine
		- The scope has a sniper bullet meter.

Equiptment CHDT's
	- They don't show.

Scoreboard (000012BD)
	- The "Who Am I" arrow should not be handled by the CHDT and therefore isn't positioned correctly.
