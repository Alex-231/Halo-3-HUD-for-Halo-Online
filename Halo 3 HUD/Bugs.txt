Bugs:

Monitor (000025F4)
	- The radar is oval, like the spartan's radar, when it should be circle.
	- The monitor uses spartan globals, this should be fixed.
	- turbulance alignment

Sandbox (000012C1)
	- The crosshair shouldn't be centered. This is making scaling the binoculars a difficulty.

Spartan (00000C1E)

Weapon CHDT's
	- The pickup weapon widget is incorrect. this should be handled by the weapon tag, like the out of ammo text.
		- This is also breaking the dual weild pickup text, and presumably the take from ally text.

	Plasma Turret:
		- The battery number flashes red, a simple anim removal will fix this.
		- There are no meter flashes.
		- There is no divider.

	Machine Gun Turret:
		- There are no meter flashes

Equiptment CHDT's
	- They don't show.

Scoreboard (000012BD)
	- The "Who Am I" arrow should not be handled by the CHDT and therefore isn't positioned correctly.

Globals CHGD
	- VIP / Objective Waypoints are broken.
